KNOWN PYXSER ISSUES:

* Can't get any type defined in the __main__ module, this
  means that every class defined in __main__ can not be
  deserialized.

- Can't install on Mac OS X. The pyxser DTD isn't installed
  on the Python library directory, instead it is installed
  on the User Library directory.
  SOLVED: now it runs under Mac OS X.
